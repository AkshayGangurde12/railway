# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables deployment of the full-stack MediCare application to Vercel, including the React frontend and Node.js backend API. The deployment should maintain all existing functionality while providing scalable serverless hosting with automatic deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Deployment to Vercel

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the MediCare web application through a public URL, so that I can use the service from anywhere with fast global CDN delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is deployed THEN the system SHALL serve the React application from Vercel's global CDN
2. WHEN users visit the Vercel URL THEN the system SHALL load the complete MediCare interface
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL optimize all assets for production
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide a public HTTPS URL
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL connect properly to the backend API

### Requirement 2: Backend API Deployment to Vercel Functions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend API deployed as Vercel serverless functions, so that it can handle requests scalably without server management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN the system SHALL run all Express routes as Vercel serverless functions
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle authentication, appointments, and messaging
3. WHEN functions start THEN the system SHALL connect to MongoDB Atlas successfully
4. WHEN email functionality is used THEN the system SHALL send emails through the deployed functions
5. WHEN multiple requests occur THEN the system SHALL scale automatically

### Requirement 3: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure environment variable management, so that sensitive credentials are protected in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL use Vercel environment variables
2. WHEN sensitive data is needed THEN the system SHALL access it through secure environment configuration
3. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL allow updates through Vercel dashboard
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Automatic Deployment and CI/CD

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic deployments from Git, so that updates are deployed efficiently when code is pushed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger deployment
2. WHEN deployment runs THEN the system SHALL build and deploy both frontend and backend
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide preview URLs for testing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and maintain previous version
5. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL create preview deployments

### Requirement 5: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance monitoring and optimization, so that the application runs efficiently and issues are detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide fast loading times globally
2. WHEN functions execute THEN the system SHALL optimize cold start times
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring data
5. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL scale automatically without intervention
