# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables deployment of the MediCare backend API to Railway, providing a scalable Node.js/Express server that connects to the Vercel-hosted frontend. The deployment should maintain all existing functionality while providing reliable backend hosting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend API Deployment to Railway

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend API deployed to Railway, so that the Vercel frontend can communicate with a reliable backend service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN the system SHALL run the Express server on Railway
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle authentication, appointments, and messaging
3. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL connect to MongoDB Atlas successfully
4. WHEN email functionality is used THEN the system SHALL send emails through the deployed service
5. WHEN the frontend makes requests THEN the system SHALL respond with proper CORS headers

### Requirement 2: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure environment variable management on Railway, so that sensitive credentials are protected in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Railway THEN the system SHALL use Railway environment variables
2. WHEN sensitive data is needed THEN the system SHALL access it through secure environment configuration
3. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL allow updates through Railway dashboard
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3: Frontend-Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless communication between the Vercel frontend and Railway backend, so that all application features work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL route them to the Railway backend
2. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL allow requests from the Vercel domain
3. WHEN real-time features are used THEN the system SHALL maintain WebSocket connections
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens correctly
5. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL handle them through Cloudinary integration
