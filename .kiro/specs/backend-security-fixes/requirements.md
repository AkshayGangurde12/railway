# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security vulnerabilities, deprecated MongoDB configuration options, and SMTP authentication issues in the backend application. The goal is to ensure the application runs securely without warnings or authentication errors while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Vulnerability Resolution

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all npm security vulnerabilities resolved, so that the application is protected against known security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm audit is run THEN the system SHALL show zero high or critical vulnerabilities
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use updated, secure versions of all dependencies
3. WHEN axios is used THEN the system SHALL use version 1.11.1 or higher to prevent DoS attacks
4. WHEN form-data is used THEN the system SHALL use version 4.0.4 or higher to prevent unsafe random boundary generation
5. WHEN nodemailer is used THEN the system SHALL use version 7.0.7 or higher to prevent domain interpretation conflicts
6. WHEN validator is used THEN the system SHALL use version 13.15.16 or higher to prevent URL validation bypass

### Requirement 2: MongoDB Configuration Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MongoDB connection to use current configuration options, so that deprecation warnings are eliminated and the connection is future-proof.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects to MongoDB THEN the system SHALL NOT use deprecated useNewUrlParser option
2. WHEN the application connects to MongoDB THEN the system SHALL NOT use deprecated useUnifiedTopology option
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to MongoDB without any deprecation warnings
4. WHEN MongoDB connection is established THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 3: SMTP Authentication Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper SMTP authentication setup, so that email functionality works without authentication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application attempts to send emails THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully with Gmail SMTP
2. WHEN EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are configured THEN the system SHALL use App Password instead of regular password
3. WHEN SMTP connection is tested THEN the system SHALL NOT produce authentication error 535
4. WHEN email sending is attempted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for configuration issues
5. IF Gmail 2FA is enabled THEN the system SHALL require and use App Password for authentication

### Requirement 4: Environment Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment variable validation, so that configuration issues are detected early and clearly communicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN EMAIL_PASS is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on App Password setup
3. WHEN MONGODB_URI is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear connection error messages
4. WHEN environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent application startup with informative error messages
