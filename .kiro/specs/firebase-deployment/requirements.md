# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables deployment of the full-stack MediCare application to Firebase, including the React frontend on Firebase Hosting and the Node.js backend on Firebase Functions. The deployment should maintain all existing functionality while providing scalable cloud hosting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Deployment to Firebase Hosting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the MediCare web application through a public URL, so that I can use the service from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is deployed THEN the system SHALL serve the React application from Firebase Hosting
2. WHEN users visit the Firebase URL THEN the system SHALL load the complete MediCare interface
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL optimize all assets for production
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide a public HTTPS URL
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL connect properly to the backend API

### Requirement 2: Backend API Deployment to Firebase Functions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend API deployed to Firebase Functions, so that it can handle requests scalably and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN the system SHALL run all Express routes as Firebase Functions
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle authentication, appointments, and messaging
3. WHEN the function starts THEN the system SHALL connect to MongoDB Atlas successfully
4. WHEN email functionality is used THEN the system SHALL send emails through the deployed function
5. WHEN Socket.IO is used THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time communication capabilities

### Requirement 3: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure environment variable management, so that sensitive credentials are protected in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying functions THEN the system SHALL use Firebase environment configuration
2. WHEN sensitive data is needed THEN the system SHALL access it through Firebase config
3. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL allow updates without redeployment
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Custom Domain and SSL Configuration

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the application accessible via a custom domain with SSL, so that users have a professional and secure experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom domain is configured THEN the system SHALL serve the application from that domain
2. WHEN users access the site THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS
3. WHEN SSL certificates are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically provision and renew them
4. WHEN the domain is accessed THEN the system SHALL load without security warnings
5. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use the correct backend URL for the environment

### Requirement 5: Deployment Automation and CI/CD

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment processes, so that updates can be deployed efficiently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is ready for deployment THEN the system SHALL provide simple deployment commands
2. WHEN deployment runs THEN the system SHALL build and deploy both frontend and backend
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify successful deployment
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and rollback options
5. WHEN multiple environments are needed THEN the system SHALL support staging and production deployments
